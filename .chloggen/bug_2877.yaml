  Create a Service Monitor for the collector Service when Prometheus exporter is used. A different Service Monitor is created for the monitoring service.
  This helps excluding the headless service (duplicating the metrics collection) and splits responsibilities between the two Service Monitors.
  Now, the operator.opentelemetry.io/collector-service-type label is used to differentiate the services.
  operator.opentelemetry.io/collector-monitoring-service and operator.opentelemetry.io/collector-headless-service are deprecated now.
